00:06 The entire time I knew him, he only ever had one goal.
00:14 To wipe out half the universe.
00:17 If he gets all the Infinity Stones.
00:20 He can do it with the snap of his fingers.
00:23 Just like that.
00:25 Tell me his name again.
00:26 Thanos.
00:36 We got one advantage.
00:39 He's coming to us.
00:43 We have what Thanos wants.
00:45 So that's what we use.
00:54 Let's talk about this plan of yours.
00:56 I think it's good except it sucks.
00:58 So let me do the plan and that way it might be really good.
01:02 Wow.
01:10 The end is near.
01:18 When I'm done,
01:21 Half of humanity will still exist.
01:32 Perfectly balanced.
01:36 As all things should be.
01:42 I hope they remember you.
02:02 I'm Peter, by the way.
02:04 Doctor Strange.
02:05 Oh!
02:05 You're using our made-up names.
02:07 Then I am Spider-Man.
