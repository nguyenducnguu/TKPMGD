00:05 Eggsy, I saw in you, what someone once saw in me
00:10 Something that can't be taught
00:13 The makings of a Kingsman
00:15 Being a Kingsman is more than clothing to wear
00:18 or the weapons we bag
00:21 it's about being willing to sacrifice, for the greater good
00:25 I hope you're ready
00:27 For what comes next
01:30 Oh my god
01:31 Harry?
